## Overview

**QGIS-RRIM** is a QGIS plugin that implements the Red Relief Image Map (RRIM) technique for enhanced terrain visualization using digital elevation models.

## Methodology

The plugin generates the fundamental raster layers required for RRIM visualization:

- Slope
- Differential openness

These layers are combined to enhance micro-topography, scarps, lineaments, and subtle geomorphic features while remaining largely independent of illumination direction.

## Applications

- Geomorphological mapping
- Morphostructural analysis
- Tectonic interpretation
- High-resolution topographic analysis

## Implementation

The plugin is fully integrated into the QGIS Processing Toolbox and supports multiple DEM sources, including LiDAR-derived datasets.

## Release

GitHub release available through the official repository.
