## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a reproducible, GIS-based multiscale multifractal framework for the analysis of geological and geophysical lineament datasets.

## Motivation & Context

Fractal and multifractal methods provide quantitative descriptors of spatial complexity, yet their application in geological interpretation often lacks reproducibility and methodological consistency.

This framework aims to standardize the analytical workflow within GIS and Python-based environments.

## Methodology

The framework integrates:

- Structural and morphological lineament datasets
- Multiscale box-counting and multifractal analysis
- Spatial interpolation of fractal metrics
- Structural correlation with geological and geophysical data

All processing steps are designed to be transparent and reproducible.

## Applications

- Structural domain characterization
- Lineament network complexity assessment
- Integration of geological and geophysical interpretations

## Current Status

Methodological development and validation are ongoing, with emphasis on statistical robustness and scalability.
