## Overview

**GeoMorphX** is an open-source framework aimed at unifying advanced geomorphometric analysis and perceptual terrain visualization within a modular and extensible architecture.

## Scope

The project focuses on bridging quantitative terrain analysis with visualization techniques to support geomorphological and structural interpretation.

## Current Status

GeoMorphX is currently in early development stages, with conceptual design and core architectural decisions under active discussion.

## Future Directions

- Modular geomorphometric analysis tools
- Advanced terrain visualization methods
- Integration with GIS and Python-based workflows
