## Overview

**PetroPyQAPF** is a Python-based application for the modal classification of plutonic igneous rocks following the IUGS-recommended QAPF scheme, with a workflow tailored to thin-section petrographic analysis.

## Motivation & Context

Modal QAPF classification is a standard procedure in igneous petrology, yet it is often performed manually or using ad hoc spreadsheets, limiting reproducibility and consistency.

This project formalizes the classification process within a transparent and reproducible computational framework.

## Methodology

The application includes:

- User-defined modal proportions of QAPF minerals
- Petrographically consistent normalization procedures
- Automatic determination of the official IUGS rock name
- Visualization within the appropriate QAPF ternary diagram

Qualitative petrographic descriptors are included to contextualize interpretations without altering the normative classification.

## Outputs

- Official QAPF rock classification
- Annotated ternary diagrams
- Concise petrographic summaries

## Current Status

Core classification routines are implemented. Interface development and workflow validation are ongoing.

## Future Work

- Optional AI-assisted qualitative petrographic feedback
- PDF export for academic reporting and teaching
