## Overview

This project integrates classical CIPW normative petrology with modern machine learning techniques for the systematic classification of igneous rocks.

## Methodology

- CIPW normative calculations following the Cross–Iddings–Pirsson–Washington formulation
- Compilation and QA/QC of major-oxide geochemical datasets
- Feature extraction from normative mineral assemblages
- Training of Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM models
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Stratified cross-validation

## Dataset

- Initial compilation: 3,358 igneous rock samples from Peru
- Final validated dataset: 2,707 samples after QA/QC and standardization

## Results

- Volcanic rocks: classification accuracy ≈ 0.80–0.82
- Plutonic rocks: classification accuracy ≈ 0.52–0.56

Performance differences reflect mineralogical complexity and compositional overlap.

## Contributions

The project demonstrates the integration of petrological reasoning with data-driven classification approaches.
